## Hosted On:

https://podex-rho.vercel.app/

the app is half baked
So dont expect much
Will make it better cause i just implemented basic app.
Have a different idea for this.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
